Hi there, my name is Siddhartha Paudel, and I am currently a student at St. Xavier's College, which is affiliated with Tribhuvan University in Nepal. I was born and raised in Kathmandu, Nepal, and completed my high school education at Kathmandu Model College.

I have always had a keen interest in computer science, which is why I decided to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Information Technology. Even though I don't have a strong GPA, I consider myself a hardworking student who is dedicated to learning and growing in my field.

Apart from my academic pursuits, I am also fascinated by human psychology, and enjoy reading and learning about it in my free time. I am a big fan of anime and manga, and love to watch and read them whenever I get the chance. Music is also a big part of my life, and Kendrick Lamar is one of my favorite artists.
